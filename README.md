This is a project I started to play around with using sse and websockets in React.

Documentation is sparse for websockets in React. Most of the examples are old, from before hooks 
came out. I've also had a hard time coming up with examples on how to test any of this.

So, most of the work here is me trying to figure out how to test this.
